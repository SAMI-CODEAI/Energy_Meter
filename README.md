## ðŸš€ Installation and Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SAMI-CODEAI/sami-codeai-energy_meter.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd sami-codeai-energy_meter
   ```
3. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## ðŸ“Š Dataset
The dataset (`Energy Meter.csv`) consists of energy consumption readings, which are used to train and evaluate various ML models.

## ðŸ›  Usage
### Training and Testing Models
- Use `Training&TestingMLAlgorithmForEnergyMeter.ipynb` or `Training&TestingMLAlgorithmForEnergyMeter.py` to train and test machine learning models.

### Evaluating Models
- Use `EvaluatingVariousMLModelforEnergyMeter.ipynb` or `EvaluatingVariousMLModelforEnergyMeter.py` to compare different models and analyze their performance.

### Loading a Trained Model
- The `finalized_model.pkl` file contains the trained model, which can be loaded using:
   ```python
   import pickle
   with open('finalized_model.pkl', 'rb') as file:
       model = pickle.load(file)
   ```
